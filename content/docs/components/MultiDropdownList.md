`MultiDropdownList` creates a dropdown list based multi select UI component. It is used for filtering results based on the current selection(s) from a list of items.

Example uses:
* create an e-commerce facet like search experience.
* create a filter for airlines to fly by in a flight booking experience.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```js
<MultiDropdownList
  componentId="SearchSensor"
  dataField="brand.raw"
/>
```

### Usage With All Props

```js
<MultiDropdownList
  componentId="SearchSensor"
  dataField="brand.raw"
  placeholder="Pick a car"
  defaultSelected={["volvo"]}
  selectAllLabel="All cars"
  sortBy="count"
  showCount
  queryFormat="or"
  size={100}
  react={{
    and: ["CategoryFilter", "SearchFilter"]
  }}
/>
```

## Props

- **componentId** `String`  
    unique identifier of the component, can be referenced in other components' `react` prop.
- **dataField** `String`  
    data field to be connected to the component's UI view. This field is used for doing an aggregation and returns the result. We're using a `.raw` multifield here. You can use a field of type `keyword` or `not_analyzed` depending on your Elasticsearch cluster.
- **defaultSelected** `String Array` [optional]  
    default selected value pre-selects an option from the list.
- **placeholder** `String` [optional]  
    placeholder to be displayed in the dropdown searchbox. Defaults to "Select a value".
- **size** `Number` [optional]  
    control how many items to display in the List. Defaults to 100.
- **sortBy** `String` [optional]  
    property that decides on how to sort the list items, accepts one of `count`, `asc` or `desc` as valid values. `count` sorts the list based on the count occurences, with highest value at the top. `asc` sorts the list in the ascending order of the list item (Alphabetical). `desc` sorts the list in the descending order of the term. Defaulted to `count`.
- **showCount** `Boolean` [optional]  
    show count of number of occurences besides an item. Defaults to `true`.
- **queryFormat** `String` [optional]  
    queries the selected items from the list in one of two modes: `or`, `and`.
    * Defaults to `or` which queries for results where any of the selected list items are present.
    * In `and` mode, the applied query filters results where all of the selected items are present.
- **selectAllLabel** `String` [optional]  
    if provided, shows an extra option to select all the options in the list with the provided string value.

## Demo



## Styles

`MultiDropdownList` component supports `style` prop. Read more about it [here](/advanced/style.html).

## Extending

`MultiDropdownList` component can be extended to
1. customize the look and feel with `style`,
2. update the underlying DB query with `customQuery`,
3. connect with external interfaces using `beforeValueChange`, `onValueChange` and `onQueryChange`,
4. specify how search suggestions should be filtered using `react` prop

```js
<MultiDropdownList
  ...
  style={{ paddingBottom: 10 }}
  customQuery={
    function(value, props) {
      return {
        match: {
          data_field: "this is a test"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  beforeValueChange={
    function(value) {
      // called before the value is set
      // returns a promise
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // update state or component props
        resolve()
        // or reject()
      })
    }
  }
  onValueChange={
    function(value) {
      console.log("current value: ", value)
      // set the state
      // use the value with other js code
    }
  }
  onQueryChange={
    function(prevQuery, nextQuery) {
      // use the query with other js code
      console.log('prevQuery', prevQuery);
      console.log('nextQuery', nextQuery);
    }
  }
  // specify how and which suggestions are filtered using `react` prop.
  react={
    "and": ["pricingFilter", "dateFilter"],
    "or": ["searchFilter"]
  }
/>
```

- **style** `Object`
    CSS styles to be applied to the **MultiDropdownList** component.
- **customQuery** `Function`
    takes **value** and **props** as parameters and **returns** the data query to be applied to the component, as defined in Elasticsearch Query DSL.
    `Note:` customQuery is called on value changes in the **MultiDropdownList** component as long as the component is a part of `react` dependency of at least one other component.
- **beforeValueChange** `Function`  
    is a callback function which accepts component's future **value** as a parameter and **returns** a promise. It is called everytime before a component's value changes. The promise, if and when resolved, triggers the execution of the component's query and if rejected, kills the query execution. This method can act as a gatekeeper for query execution, since it only executes the query after the provided promise has been resolved.
- **onValueChange** `Function`  
    is a callback function which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called everytime the component's value changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect on value selection. For example: You want to show a pop-up modal with the valid discount coupon code when a user searches for something in the MultiDropdownList.
- **onQueryChange** `Function`  
    is a callback function which accepts component's **prevQuery** and **nextQuery** as parameters. It is called everytime the component's query changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect whenever the component's query would change.
- **react** `Object`  
    specify dependent components to reactively update **MultiDropdownList's** suggestions.
    - **key** `String`  
        one of `and`, `or`, `not` defines the combining clause.
        - **and** clause implies that the results will be filtered by matches from **all** of the associated component states.
        - **or** clause implies that the results will be filtered by matches from **at least one** of the associated component states.
        - **not** clause implies that the results will be filtered by an **inverse** match of the associated component states.
    - **value** `String or Array or Object`  
        - `String` is used for specifying a single component by its `componentId`.
        - `Array` is used for specifying multiple components by their `componentId`.
        - `Object` is used for nesting other key clauses.
